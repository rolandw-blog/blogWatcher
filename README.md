# Typescript Basics

I can't find a way to auto-attach to processes spanwed in an external terminal. Using `F1 -> Debug: Attach to Node Process` works fine though.

* For `npm run dev` attach to the `ts-node` process (not npm run dev)
* For `npm run start` you can attach to either the node process, or the npm script
